# web3-jsonrpc-gateway

A Web3 JSON-RPC provider gateway that handles accounts on its own using Ethers.js, or other SDKs, but delegates chain queries to a 3rd party "destination provider", e.g. Infura, Cloudflare, Conflux, BOBA-L2, etc.

## Compilation

```console
yarn build
```

## Release

This repository is released automatically in [DockerHub](https://github.com/witnet/web3-jsonrpc-gateway/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml) and [npm](https://github.com/witnet/web3-jsonrpc-gateway/blob/main/.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml) using GitHub actions when a new release is detected in the repository.

## Running a single server instance, depending on destination provider type:

### Infura as destination provider:

```console
node dist/bin/ethers/infura
```

Required environment variables:

- `W3GW_PORT`: listening port for the server. Can also be passed from command-line as first parameter.
- `W3GW_NETWORK`: network name. Infura supports: `mainnet`, `ropsten`, `rinkeby`, `kovan` and `goerli`.
- `W3GW_SEED_PHRASE`: the seed phrase to use for the server's own wrapped wallet, in BIP-39 mnemonics format.
- `W3GW_PROVIDER_KEY`: your Infura project ID.

Optional environment variables:

- `EVM_CALL_INTERLEAVE_BLOCKS`: number of blocks before latest knwon upon which EVM read-only calls will be bound to; this variable defaults to zero.
- `INFURA_GAS_LIMIT`: default gas limit, if not specified by the client; or maximum gas limit threshold if either estimated by the provider, or provided by the client.
- `INFURA_GAS_PRICE`: default gas price, if not specified by the client; or maximum gas price threshold if either estimated by the provider, or provided by the client.
- `INFURA_GAS_PRICE_FACTOR`: multiplier applied to gas prices estimated by provider.
- `W3GW_LOG_LEVEL`: max log level to be traced, can be any of the following: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `http`, `verbose`, `debug`, `silly`. If not specified, `verbose` will apply.
- `W3GW_NUM_WALLETS`: number of wallet addresses to be handled by the gateway, derived from path '`m/44'/60'/0'/0/*`'.

### Celo-compatible destination providers:

- `W3GW_PRIVATE_KEYS`: array of private keys to be used for signing transactions.

Optional environment variables:

- `CELO_FEE_CURRENCY`: ERC-20 token address to be used for paying transaction gas. Native CELO will be used if none specified.
- `CELO_GAS_LIMIT_FACTOR`: factor by which the provider-estimated gas limit will be multiplied, before signing transactions.
- `CELO_GAS_PRICE_FACTOR`: factor by which the provider-estimated gas price minimum will be multiplied, before signing transactions.

```

Required environment variables:

Optional environment variables:

- `CONFLUX_DEFAULT_EPOCH_LABEL`: default epoch label to be used on read-only RPC calls, if none is specified by the caller; this variable will default to `"latest_finalized"` if none is set.
- `CONFLUX_ESTIMATE_GAS_PRICE`: if set to `true`, the provider will be asked to estimate the gas price, before signing the transaction; if the provider-estimated gas price is greater than `CONFLUX_GAS_PRICE`, the transaction will be rejected by the gateway.

### Generic destination providers:

```console
node ./dist/bin/ethers
```

Generic destination providers need to comply with the `JsonRpcProvider` type from the `Ethers.js` library:

- [jsonrpcprovider](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/blob/d395d16fa357ec5dda9b59922cf21c39dc34c071/packages/providers/src.ts/json-rpc-provider.ts#L279-L612)
- [Ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js)

Required environment variables:

- `W3GW_PORT`: listening port for the server. Can also be passed from command-line as a second parameter.
- `W3GW_SEED_PHRASE`: the seed phrase to use for the server's own wrapped wallet, in BIP-39 mnemonics format.
- `W3GW_PROVIDER_URL`: actual URL of the Web3 JSON-RPC provider. Can also be passed from command-line as a first parameter.

Optional environment variables:

- `W3GW_NETWORK`: the network name to connect with.

- `ETHERS_ALWAYS_SYNCED`: if set to `true`, the gateway will intercept calls to `eth_syncing` as to return `false` in all cases..
- `ETHERS_ESTIMATE_GAS_LIMIT`: if set to `true`, the provider will be asked to estimate the gas limit, before signing the transaction; if the provider-estimated gas limit is greater than `ETHERS_GAS_LIMIT`, the transaction will be rejected by the gateway.
- `ETHERS_ESTIMATE_GAS_PRICE`: if set to `true`, the provider will be asked to estimate the gas price, before signing the transaction; if the provider-estimated gas price is greater than `ETHERS_GAS_PRICE`, the transaction will be rejected by the gateway.
- `ETHERS_GAS_LIMIT`: default gas limit, if not specified by the client; or maximum gas limit threshold if either estimated by the provider, or provided by the client.
- `ETHERS_GAS_PRICE`: default gas price, if not specified by the client; or maximum gas price threshold if either estimated by the provider, or provided by the client.

- `EVM_CALL_INTERLEAVE_BLOCKS`: number of blocks before latest knwon upon which EVM read-only calls will be bound to; this variable defaults to zero.

## Pre-configured JSON-RPC provider gateways:

There are several package scripts at your disposal for you to launch specific gateways to multiple WEB3-compatible blockchains, and different possible networks within them.

**Important**: In order to these batch scripts to work properly, please rename `.env_batch_example` to `.env`, and fulfill the following parameters:

- `EVM_CALL_INTERLEAVE_BLOCKS`: number of blocks before latest knwon upon which EVM read-only calls will be bound to; this variable defaults to zero.
- `W3GW_PROVIDER_KEY`: your Infura's project id to be used with `Infura`-connected servers.
- `W3GW_LOG_LEVEL`: max log level to be traced, can be any of the following: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `http`, `verbose`, `debug`, `silly`. If not specified, `verbose` will apply.
- `W3GW_PRIVATE_KEYS`: array of private keys to be used by `Conflux` and `Celo` -alike providers.
- `W3GW_SEED_PHRASE`: seed phrase to be used with either `Infura` or `Ethers.js` providers.

## How to create a server for any other provider

To integrate with a different provider, you can create your own script that creates the provider and then build a server around it. Please, have a look to provided examples in `src/bin/**`.
